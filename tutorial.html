    <h2>Hello there!</h2>

    <h3>Welcome to Typing Hero!</h3>
    <p>In this game, you type the sentence that appears on-screen. There are three difficulty levels, ranging from relatively normal-looking sentences to random characters, and each difficulty grants a different number of experience points (xp). For each character incorrectly typed (this does include spaces), your xp reward will decrease slightly, but at least 50% of the possible total reward will be given once you finish the sentence.</p>
    <p>As you earn experience, you will also gain levels (leveling up). Leveling up happens frequently at lower levels, but gets more difficult as your level gets higher.</p>
    <p>Hope you have fun playing Typing Hero!</p>
